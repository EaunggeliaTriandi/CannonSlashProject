# CannonSlashProject
A game project i made using unity engine, this game has a target whuich mean a Score, it's because this game using highscore system on it.

To play this game, all player need to do is connect a computer to "Kinect 360" and for best experience i recommended using VR also imagine there a two sword on their hands just like on the game and then slash all cannon ball that will gonna shoot any time from the cannon in front of player, and the longer player play the game then the cannon ball will getting faster. HP will decreased by 1 when player failed to slash a cannon ball, and Ccore will increased by 50 when player have succesfuly slash the cannon ball.
